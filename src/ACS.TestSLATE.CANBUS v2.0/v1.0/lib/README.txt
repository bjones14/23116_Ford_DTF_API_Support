This folder is where all your plug-in's 3rd party library dependecies go. As part of the build process, these files will be copied along with the contents of the \bin folder to the Test SLATE\bin folder.

Example: If you're plug-in has a dependency on DevExpress' XtraGrid, place any and all necessary redistributables in this folder. 
DevExpress.XtraGrid.dll
DevExpress.Data.dll
DevExpress.Utils.dll
DevExpress.XtraEditors.dll
... etc ...
